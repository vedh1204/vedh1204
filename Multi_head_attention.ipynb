      "‚Ä¢ Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci[b] (15 April 1452 ‚Äì 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.[3] While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal,[4] and his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.[3][4] Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of imitators and students.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ In 2017, Salvator Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo,[5] was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ Two angels kneel at the left.\n",
      "‚Ä¢ These studies and Leon Battista Alberti's treatise De pictura were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.[34][42] Much of the painting in Verrocchio's workshop was done by his assistants.\n"
